## **2. Understanding Azure (15 minutes)**

### **2.1 What is Azure?**

Azure is Microsoftâ€™s cloud computing platform offering over 200 services spanning computing, storage, AI, and networking, allowing businesses to build and manage applications globally.

### **2.2 Core Services and Capabilities**

|**Category**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Compute**|Virtual Machines (VMs), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Functions|
|**Storage**|Blob Storage, Azure SQL Database, Cosmos DB|
|**AI & ML**|Cognitive Services, Azure Machine Learning|
|**Networking**|Virtual Networks, Load Balancers, Azure Front Door|
|**Hybrid & Multi-Cloud**|Azure Arc for seamless on-prem/cloud integration|

### **2.3 Why Azure?**
- **Security & Compliance:** Meets industry and government regulations.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Pay-as-you-go model minimizes upfront investment.
- **Hybrid Flexibility:** Integrates on-premises infrastructure with the cloud.

#### **Use Case:** 
A multinational retailer migrates its legacy inventory system to Azure for real-time stock updates, high availability, and cost savings.

## **3. Foundations of DevOps (15 minutes)**

### **3.1 DevOps Defined**

DevOps is a cultural and technical movement that fosters collaboration between software development and IT operations, enhancing automation and accelerating delivery cycles.

### **3.2 Principles of DevOps**

|**Principle**|**Objective**|
|---|---|
|**Collaboration**|Encourages shared responsibility between teams.|
|**Automation**|Reduces manual errors and accelerates workflows.|
|**Continuous Integration (CI)**|Ensures seamless code integration and early testing.|
|**Continuous Delivery (CD)**|Automates deployment to production.|
|**Monitoring & Feedback**|Enables proactive issue detection and resolution.|

### **3.3 Why DevOps?**

- **Faster Time-to-Market:** Automates testing and deployment.
- **Higher Reliability:** Continuous monitoring improves performance.
- **Better Collaboration:** Bridges gaps between developers and IT teams.

#### **Scenario:** 
An e-commerce platform improves uptime and reduces deployment failures by implementing CI/CD pipelines.

## **4. Azure DevOps: A Unified Solution (15 minutes)**

### **4.1 What is Azure DevOps?**

Azure DevOps is a suite of services that streamlines the software development lifecycle (SDLC), enabling agile planning, code management, CI/CD automation, and monitoring.

### **4.2 Core Components**

|**Component**|**Functionality**|
|---|---|
|**Azure Boards**|Agile project management with Scrum and Kanban boards.|
|**Azure Repos**|Git repositories for secure version control.|
|**Azure Pipelines**|CI/CD workflows for automated builds and deployments.|
|**Azure Test Plans**|Manual and automated testing solutions.|
|**Azure Artifacts**|Secure package management and dependency sharing.|

#### **Example:** 
A fintech startup uses Azure DevOps to automate their software delivery pipeline, reducing release cycles from weeks to days.

### **6.1 Configuring a GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline**

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build
```

### **6.2 Deploying with Azure Pipelines**

```yaml
trigger:
- main

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildApp
    steps:
    - script: npm install
    - script: npm test
- stage: Deploy
  jobs:
  - job: DeployApp
    steps:
    - script: az webapp up --name MyApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```
