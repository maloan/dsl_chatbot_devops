## **3. What is DevOps? (10 minutes)**

DevOps combines development (**Dev**) and IT operations (**Ops**) practices to improve collaboration, automate workflows, and deliver high-quality software faster.

### **3.1 Core Principles of DevOps**

|**Principle**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Collaboration**|Teams share responsibilities and goals.|
|**Automation**|Reduces manual errors with automated workflows.|
|**Continuous Integration (CI)**|Automatically integrates and tests code changes.|
|**Continuous Delivery (CD)**|Automates deployment to production environments.|
|**Monitoring**|Tracks application performance and alerts teams to issues.|

> **Scenario:** A team managing an online marketplace uses DevOps practices to automate the deployment of new features, reducing downtime and bugs.

### **3.2 Benefits of DevOps**

|**Benefit**|**Impact**|
|---|---|
|**Faster Delivery**|Reduces time-to-market for new features.|
|**Improved Quality**|Automated testing catches bugs earlier.|
|**Scalability**|Dynamically scales infrastructure with demand.|
|**Increased Collaboration**|Encourages shared responsibility between teams.|

## **4. What is Azure DevOps? (10 minutes)**

Azure DevOps is a suite of tools to manage the entire software lifecycle. It integrates planning, coding, building, testing, and deploying seamlessly.

### **4.1 Core Components**

|**Component**|**Purpose**|
|---|---|
|**Azure Boards**|Plan and track tasks using Kanban or Scrum boards.|
|**Azure Repos**|Host Git repositories for version control.|
|**Azure Pipelines**|Automate CI/CD workflows.|
|**Azure Test Plans**|Manage manual and automated testing.|
|**Azure Artifacts**|Share dependencies and packages securely.|

> **Example:** A software team uses Azure Boards to manage tasks, Azure Repos for version control, and Azure Pipelines to automate deployments.

### **4.2 Key Features**

1. **Cross-Platform:** Works with multiple OS and programming languages.
2. **Flexible Integrations:** Supports tools like GitHub, Jenkins, and Kubernetes.
3. **Scalable:** Suitable for small startups and large enterprises.

## **5. Real-World Scenarios (15 minutes)**

### **5.1 Application Modernization**

|**Challenge**|**Solution with Azure DevOps**|
|---|---|
|Monolithic legacy systems|Refactor into microservices using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).|
|Manual deployments|Automate with Azure Pipelines for faster, error-free releases.|
|Limited scalability|Enable auto-scaling with Azure compute resources.|

---

### **5.2 Building Chatbots**

|**Component**|**Azure Service**|
|---|---|
|NLP and Intent Recognition|Azure Cognitive Services|
|Conversation Flow Management|Azure Bot Service|
|Real-Time Performance Metrics|Azure Monitor and Application Insights|

> **Practical Example:** A chatbot deployed for customer service uses Azure Cognitive Services for language understanding and Azure Bot Service for managing conversation flows.

## **6. Hands-On: Setting Up a CI/CD Pipeline (15 minutes)**

### **6.1 CI/CD with GitHub Actions**

1. **Initialize a GitHub Repository**:
    
    - Create a new repository and upload project files.
2. **Add a Workflow File**:
    
    - Create `.github/workflows/main.yml` in your repository.

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Build Application
        run: npm run build
```

3. **Monitor Progress**:
    - View the "Actions" tab in GitHub to track pipeline status.

### **6.2 Deploying with Azure Pipelines**

1. **Create a Pipeline**:
    
    - Navigate to Azure DevOps > Pipelines > New Pipeline.
    - Connect your GitHub repository.
2. **Define Tasks in YAML**:
    

```yaml
trigger:
- main

stages:
- stage: Build
  jobs:
  - job: BuildApp
    steps:
    - script: npm install
    - script: npm test
- stage: Deploy
  jobs:
  - job: DeployApp
    steps:
    - script: az webapp up --name MyApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup
```

3. **Run and Monitor**:
    - Save the pipeline, queue a run, and monitor progress in the Azure DevOps dashboard.

## **7. Best Practices (5 minutes)**

1. **Automate Early**:
    
    - Automate testing, building, and deployment with CI/CD.
2. **Secure Your Pipelines**:
    
    - Use Azure Key Vault to store sensitive data like API keys.
3. **Monitor Continuously**:
    
    - Use Azure Monitor to track performance and set up alerts for potential issues.
4. **Encourage Collaboration**:
    
    - Use Azure Boards to improve transparency and teamwork.
