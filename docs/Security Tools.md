| **HTTPS**                                 | Web-Based      | Secure data in transit (web traffic)  | Protects against interception, widely supported | SSL certificates require setup and maintenance | Free with Let's Encrypt, paid options available | [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) |
| **Self-Destructing Messages**             | Cross-Platform | Data protection by automatic deletion | Limits data exposure                            | Requires implementation and management         | Varies based on implementation                  | N/A                                       |
| **Authentication (OAuth 2.0, MFA, RBAC)** | Cross-Platform | User authentication and API security  | Enhances security, role-based access control    | Setup complexity, potential user friction      | Varies based on service used                    | [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)         |
#### HTTPS
**Overview**: HTTPS protects data in transit, essential for preventing data interception.

**Implementation Guidelines**:
- Obtain and configure SSL certificates.
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
