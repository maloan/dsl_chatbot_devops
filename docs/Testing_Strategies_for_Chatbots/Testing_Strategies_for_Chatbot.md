|---|---|---|---|---|
|**[Unit](Data_science_lab/dsl_chatbot_devops/code-examples/Example%20Pytest%20Unit%20Test.md) Testing**|Focuses on testing individual components, such as intent recognition.| Jest, Mocha, pytest, unittest|Fast feedback, early bug detection, automated execution.|Limited scope (only small, isolated components).|
|**Integration Testing**|Ensures interaction between modules (APIs, databases, etc.) works well.| Postman, Supertest, pytest-django|Comprehensive testing of interactions, detects issues in interfaces.|Slower execution compared to unit tests.|
|**E2E Testing**|Validates full workflows by simulating real user interactions.| Cypress, Selenium, Puppeteer| Tests real-world scenarios, end-to-end validation of workflows.|Time-consuming, complex setup.|
|**Performance Testing**|Assesses the system under stress to identify scalability issues.| JMeter, Locust, k6|Provides scalability insights, detects bottlenecks early.|Resource-intensive, setup complexity.|
|**Security Testing**|Identifies and mitigates vulnerabilities in the chatbot.| OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Snyk| Comprehensive vulnerability testing, supports automated/manual.|Requires security expertise, can be time-consuming.|
|**Usability Testing**|Focuses on gathering feedback about the chatbot’s user experience.|UserTesting.com, Lookback, Hotjar|Direct feedback from users, improves UX and interaction design.|Subjective data, can be resource-intensive.|
|**Regression Testing**|Ensures that new changes or updates don’t break existing functionality.| Selenium, Cypress, Jest|Continuous validation, prevents regressions in functionality.|Requires thorough setup and maintenance of test cases.|
|**A/B Testing**|Compares two versions of a chatbot feature to assess user engagement.| Optimizely, Split.io, Google Optimize|Data-driven decisions, improves user engagement over time.|Requires significant user traffic for meaningful results.|
