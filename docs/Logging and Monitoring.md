### **Key Monitoring Metrics**
1. **User Interactions**:
   - Track engagement levels and success rates.
   - Analyze peak usage hours and dropped conversations.

2. **Error Monitoring**:
   - Log errors with context (e.g., API failures, response errors).
   - Track HTTP errors and bot failures for debugging.

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Monitor for server bottlenecks and potential scaling issues.
   - Measure response times to user queries.
   - Track CPU, memory, and network performance of the backend infrastructure.
