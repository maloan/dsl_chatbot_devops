### 2. **Prometheus & Grafana**

#### Overview
- **Prometheus** is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, widely used in cloud-native environments, especially with Kubernetes.
- **Grafana** is an open-source visualization platform that integrates with Prometheus to create customizable dashboards for system insights.

#### Use Cases
- **Kubernetes Monitoring**: Captures metrics on cluster health, pod performance, and resource usage.
- **Custom Dashboards**: Enables the creation of tailored visualizations for complex cloud applications.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Uses **Alertmanager** for custom alerts and integrates with notification channels like Slack and email.

#### Advantages
- **Custom Metrics**: Offers a flexible data model and PromQL for detailed time-series analysis.
- **Cost-Effective**: Both tools are free and ideal for small to medium deployments.
- **Scalability**: Effectively handles large-scale applications in Kubernetes environments.

#### Disadvantages
- **Complex Setup**: Requires manual configuration for storage, scaling, and data retention.
- **Limited Long-Term Storage**: Local data storage is not ideal for long-term needs unless paired with solutions like **Thanos** or **Cortex**.

#### Cost
- Both tools are free, but infrastructure costs may arise for storage and computing resources.
