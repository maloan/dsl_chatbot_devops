## **2.2 Data Collection**

### **Overview**

Data collection serves as the backbone of Azure Monitor, aggregating telemetry from applications, infrastructure, and networks into a centralized platform. This enables deep visibility, proactive monitoring, diagnostics, and optimization of resources and applications.

Azure Monitor gathers two primary types of telemetry:

1. **Metrics**: Numerical data representing performance, such as CPU utilization or request latency.
2. **Logs**: Event records containing detailed information, such as application errors, system changes, or user actions.

---

### **Key Features**

1. **Metrics**:
    
    - **Real-Time Visibility**: Metrics provide immediate feedback on resource and application performance with frequent updates.
    - **Built-In Metrics**: Azure Monitor automatically gathers metrics for Azure resources like virtual machines, Kubernetes clusters, and databases.
    - **Custom Metrics**: Track application or business-specific metrics, such as transaction counts or user activity.
2. **Logs**:
    
    - **Centralized Storage**: Logs from Azure resources, applications, and third-party systems are collected in Log Analytics Workspace for unified querying and analysis.
    - **Custom Log Support**: Collect logs from non-standard sources using custom data ingestion methods.
    - **Powerful Querying with KQL**: Use Kusto Query Language (KQL) for in-depth filtering, aggregation, and visualization of log data.
3. **Data Collection Rules (DCRs)**:
    
    - Enables fine-grained control over telemetry ingestion.
    - Allows filtering, routing, and transforming data before it reaches Log Analytics or Metrics Explorer, optimizing performance and cost.
4. **Agents for Data Collection**: Azure Monitor uses several agents for telemetry ingestion across diverse environments:
    
    - **Azure Monitor Agent (AMA)**:
        - Unified agent for metrics and logs collection across Azure, hybrid, and on-premises environments.
        - Supports custom and filtered telemetry using Data Collection Rules.
        - Simplifies deployment and management by replacing older agents, such as the Log Analytics Agent and Telegraf Agent.
    - **Log Analytics Agent** (Legacy):
        - Collects logs from virtual machines and forwards them to Log Analytics Workspace.
        - Still supported but is being phased out in favor of the Azure Monitor Agent.
    - **Telegraf Agent**:
        - Specialized for metrics collection, particularly for custom or external systems not natively supported by Azure Monitor.
    - **Azure Diagnostics Extension**:
        - Captures metrics and logs directly from Azure virtual machines and app services.
        - Ideal for scenarios requiring VM-specific diagnostics.

---

### **Integration Points**
