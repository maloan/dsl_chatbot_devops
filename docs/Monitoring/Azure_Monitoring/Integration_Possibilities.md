    - Authenticate using Managed Identity, API keys, or Azure Monitor credentials.
    - Build custom dashboards to visualize Azure Monitor metrics alongside data from other platforms.
4. **Elastic Stack**:
    
    - Ingest logs from Azure Monitor into Elasticsearch using data pipelines or Logstash.
    - Use Kibana to build dashboards for log analysis and troubleshooting.
    - Combine Azure Monitor telemetry with logs from non-Azure systems for a holistic view.

#### **Best Practices**

1. **Ensure Consistency Across Platforms**:
    - Use Azure Arc to standardize monitoring and management across hybrid and multi-cloud environments.
2. **Optimize Data Pipelines**:
    - Use exporters and filters to control the volume of telemetry sent to Azure Monitor or third-party tools.
3. **Tag Resources**:
    - Apply consistent tags to resources across platforms to streamline telemetry and log queries.
4. **Monitor Costs**:
    - Track data ingestion and storage costs for third-party tools like Elastic Stack and Prometheus.
