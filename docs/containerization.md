# Containerizing Chatbot with Docker

**Objective:**
Deploy the chatbot in a containerized environment to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

### **Recommended Tools:**
- **Docker:** For containerizing the chatbot.
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** For managing and scaling containers in production.

### Example Dockerfile
- [[Dockerfile]]

### Tradeoffs
- **Quick & Easy:** Docker containers are easy to set up and provide consistent environments across platforms, but require tools like Kubernetes for scalability. 
- **Important:** Use AKS for robust scalability and management as user load increases.
- **Nice-to-Have:** Kubernetes can manage more complex workflows, including rolling updates and auto-scaling.

## Steps
1. Write a `Dockerfile` to containerize the chatbot (see example).
2. Build the Docker image:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t chatbot .
   ```
3. Run the chatbot in a container:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 chatbot
   ```
