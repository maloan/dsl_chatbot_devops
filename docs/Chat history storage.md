### **Azure Cosmos DB**

#### Overview
Azure Cosmos DB is a globally distributed NoSQL database designed for high scalability and performance. It supports multiple data models and offers low-latency access, ideal for geographically distributed applications.

#### Use Cases
- **Global Applications**: Suited for applications needing low-latency data access worldwide.
- **Real-Time Chat Logs**: Effective for storing chat logs and user preferences.
- **IoT and E-commerce**: Handles large volumes of real-time data efficiently.

#### Advantages
- **Global Distribution**: Data replication across Azure regions ensures availability.
- **Elastic Scalability**: Adjusts throughput and storage automatically without downtime.
- **Multi-Model Support**: Offers flexibility with various data models.

#### Disadvantages
- **Cost**: Can be expensive for high read/write demands.
- **Complexity**: Requires careful management of partitioning and consistency.

#### Cost
Pricing is based on throughput (Request Units) and storage, with additional costs for global replication.

### **Azure SQL Database**

#### Overview
Azure SQL Database is a fully managed relational database service that offers high availability and security, ideal for applications requiring structured data and complex queries.

#### Use Cases
- **Structured Data Storage**: Best for user profiles and relational data needing ACID compliance.
- **Transaction Processing**: Suitable for financial systems and inventory management.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: Integrates well with analytics tools like Power BI.

#### Advantages
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data integrity and accuracy.
- **Built-in Security**: Features like encryption and threat detection maintain data safety.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Can scale resources as needed.

#### Disadvantages
- **Relational Models Only**: Not ideal for unstructured data; NoSQL is better for such cases.
- **Cost for High Availability**: Advanced configurations can increase expenses.

#### Cost
Pricing is based on the service tier and provisioned resources, with higher tiers offering better performance but at a higher cost.

### **Comparing Azure Cosmos DB and Azure SQL Database**
[[Azure Cosmos DB vs. Azure SQL Database]]

#### Criteria for Comparison
| Criteria                | **Azure Cosmos DB**                                      | **Azure SQL Database**                               |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Data Model**           | NoSQL (document, key-value, graph, column-family)         | Relational (SQL)                                     |
| **Scalability**          | High scalability with automatic throughput scaling       | Vertical scaling with elastic pools or partitioning   |
| **Global Distribution**  | Built-in global distribution with multi-region replication| Available with Active Geo-Replication                 |
| **Consistency Models**   | Multiple consistency levels (strong, bounded staleness, etc.)| Strict ACID compliance                                |
| **Performance**          | Low-latency reads and writes globally                     | High-performance transactional queries                |
| **Cost**                 | Higher, based on throughput and storage                   | Moderate, based on provisioned vCores and storage     |
| **Ideal Use Cases**      | Unstructured data, globally distributed applications      | Structured data, complex queries, transactional applications |

#### Hybrid Approach
Use both tools:
- **Cosmos DB** for unstructured data (e.g., chat logs).
- **SQL Database** for structured data (e.g., user profiles).

### **Supporting Technologies for Chatbot Data Storage**

#### **Caching Mechanisms**

**Overview**  
Caching stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce latency. Popular tools include **Redis** and **Memcached**.

**Use Cases**
- **Reduce Latency**: Cache data like user sessions and chatbot responses.
- **Improve Performance**: Eases database load with high read/write demand.

**Examples**
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and messaging.
- **Memcached**: Distributed caching system for dynamic web apps.

#### **Data Pruning Strategies**

**Overview**  
Data pruning is important for database performance by removing outdated chat data.

**Use Cases**  
- **Chatbot Data**: Eliminate old chat logs to keep the database manageable.
- **Archiving**: Move data to cold storage (e.g., **Azure Blob Storage**, **Amazon S3**) to reduce primary database load.

**Methods**  
- **Time-Based Deletion**: Automatically delete records older than a set date.
- **Data Summarization**: Summarize logs and delete raw data to save space while maintaining context.
