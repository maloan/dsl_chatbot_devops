# **Azure NoSQL Database Solutions**

## **1. Introduction**

### **1.1 Purpose of the Document**

This document offers a detailed overview of Azureâ€™s NoSQL database solutions. It covers key features, use cases, and decision-making criteria to help users select the most suitable database for their needs. The guide emphasizes scalability, global distribution, multi-model capabilities, and compliance with local regulations, including those in Switzerland.

### **1.2 The NoSQL Database Landscape**

NoSQL databases are designed to handle unstructured and semi-structured data, making them ideal for modern applications that require flexibility, scalability, and speed. Key use cases include:

- **IoT**: Storing and analyzing massive streams of sensor data.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: Processing large-scale data to provide instant insights.
- **Personalization and Recommendations**: Enhancing user experiences with data-driven algorithms.
- **E-commerce**: Managing dynamic catalogs and user sessions.

## **2. Azure Cosmos DB**

### **2.1 Overview**

Azure Cosmos DB is a fully managed, globally distributed NoSQL database service that supports multiple data models and provides high availability, low latency, and elastic scalability.

#### **Key Features**

- **Global Distribution**: Multi-region replication with <10ms read/write latencies, backed by an SLA.
- **Elastic Scalability**: Auto-scaling of throughput and storage.
- **Multi-Model API Support**: Includes APIs for NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, and Table.
- **Data Consistency Models**: Options range from eventual to strong consistency.
- **Partitioning**: Automatic partitioning for high-performance data management.

#### **Use Cases**

- IoT solutions requiring real-time data access.
- Stateful applications like shopping carts and session storage.
- Real-time analytics and personalized recommendations.

### **2.2 API Overview**

- **NoSQL API**: Ideal for JSON document storage with SQL-like querying.
- **MongoDB API**: For MongoDB-based applications with seamless migration capabilities.
- **Cassandra API**: Full compatibility with Cassandra Query Language (CQL) for columnar data models.
- **Gremlin API**: For graph data, supporting relationship analysis.
- **Table API**: Key-value storage for Azure Table Storage migrations.

### **2.3 Cosmos DB for NoSQL in Switzerland**

- **Regional Availability**: Available in **Switzerland North**, ensuring compliance with Swiss data residency regulations.
- **Real-World Use Cases**:
    - IoT solutions for Swiss industries.
    - Multi-region disaster recovery setups.

### **2.4 Selecting the Right API**

#### **Decision Tree**

- For **JSON querying and flexibility**: **API for NoSQL**.
- For **MongoDB compatibility**: **API for MongoDB**.
- For **high-throughput columnar data**: **API for Cassandra**.
- For **graph relationships**: **API for Gremlin**.

## **3. Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore)**

### **3.1 Overview**

Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB (vCore) is a managed service offering MongoDB compatibility with Azure integration, providing elastic scalability and simplified management.

#### **Regional Considerations**

- Currently unavailable in **Switzerland**, meaning users may need alternative services for compliance-sensitive workloads.

#### **Key Features**

- MongoDB wire protocol and BSON support.
- Auto-sharding for seamless scalability.
- Backup and restore for resilience.

### **3.2 Comparisons**

- **Cosmos DB for MongoDB vs. Other APIs**: MongoDB API is ideal for existing MongoDB ecosystems, while other APIs cater to different data models.
- **Cosmos DB for MongoDB vs. Azure Database for MongoDB**: Cosmos DB excels in global scalability, while Azure Database for MongoDB offers deeper feature parity for single-region deployments.

### **3.3 Use Cases**

- Migration of MongoDB applications to a fully managed service.
- Content management systems with flexible schema needs.
- E-commerce platforms with high write-intensive workloads.

## **4. Azure Managed Instance for Apache Cassandra**

### **4.1 Overview**

Azure Managed Cassandra offers a fully managed version of Apache Cassandra, providing scalability and hybrid capabilities, while maintaining compatibility with the open-source Cassandra environment.

#### **Key Features**

- Managed deployments with auto-scaling and backups.
- Hybrid cloud support, integrating with on-premises and multi-cloud environments.
- Integration with monitoring tools like Azure Monitor.

### **4.2 Use Cases**

- IoT solutions that require time-series data storage.
- Event streaming and high-ingestion scenarios.
- Hybrid cloud environments needing seamless replication.

### **4.3 Comparisons**

- **Managed Cassandra vs. Cosmos DB for Cassandra API**: Managed Cassandra gives more control over the open-source environment, while Cosmos DB offers multi-region capabilities and simplified management.
- **Hybrid vs. Cloud-Only Deployments**: Managed Cassandra is suited for hybrid setups, while Cosmos DB is ideal for cloud-native deployments.

### **4.4 Decision-Making Considerations**

- Choose **Managed Cassandra** for open-source compatibility and hybrid cloud needs.
- Choose **Cosmos DB** for fully managed PaaS features and global scalability.
