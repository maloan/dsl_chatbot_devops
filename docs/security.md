# Security Best Practices

**Objective:**
Secure your chatbot by encrypting data and performing security scans.

### **Recommended Tools:**
- **Azure Key Vault:** For secure secret management.
- **OWASP ZAP:** For vulnerability testing.
- **Azure Security Center:** For continuous security monitoring.
- **Encryption**: For user data in transit and at rest.

### **Tradeoffs:**
- **Quick & Easy:** Use Key Vault to manage secrets and secure communication and using encryption.
- **Important:** Run regular vulnerability scans and security checks.
- **Nice-to-Have:** Continuous security monitoring through Azure Security Center.

### Implementation
1. Enable SSL/TLS for chatbot communications.
2. Use Azure Key Vault for secret management (API keys, database credentials).
3. Implement HTTPS for communication.
4. Use OWASP ZAP or Azure Security Center to run security vulnerability scans.
