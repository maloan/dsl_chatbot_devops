# Scaling the Chatbot

**Objective:**
Ensure the chatbot scales to handle more users in the future (from 50 users to much more).

### **Recommended Tools:**
- **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS):** For managing and auto-scaling containers.
- **Azure Load Balancer:** To distribute traffic across multiple instances.
- **AWS ECS/EKS**: For container orchestration.
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless scaling.
- **Auto Scaling Groups**: For horizontal scaling based on traffic.

### **Tradeoffs:**
- **Quick & Easy:** AKS handles auto-scaling, but requires some setup.
- **Important:** Proper load balancing ensures smooth scaling as users increase.
- **Nice-to-Have:** Use horizontal scaling for microservices architectures.

### Considerations
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Use AWS ECS or EKS for managing containers with automatic scaling based on demand.
- **Serverless Scaling**: AWS Lambda can handle bursts of user traffic without needing to provision servers.

### **How to Implement:**
- Deploy the chatbot on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) for auto-scaling.
- Use load balancing to distribute traffic effectively.
