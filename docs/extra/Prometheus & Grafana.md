# Prometheus: Overview

## Introduction
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit known for its simplicity, particularly in cloud-native environments. Originally developed at SoundCloud in 2012, it has become the go-to tool for Kubernetes monitoring.

### Key Features
- **Data Model**: Time series data identified by metric name and key/value labels.
- **PromQL**: A powerful query language for efficient data access.
- **Standalone Servers**: No dependency on distributed storage.
- **Data Collection**: Primarily uses a pull model over HTTP.
- **Service Discovery**: Supports both dynamic and static target discovery.
- **Visualization**: Compatible with Grafana and other visualization tools.
For a detailed overview, visit the official [Prometheus features page](https://prometheus.io/).

### Components
- **Prometheus Server**: Collects and stores metrics.
- **Client Libraries**: Help instrument application code.
- **Push Gateway**: For short-lived jobs.
- **Exporters**: For various services.
- **Alertmanager**: Handles alerts.
Most components are built in Go, which supports easy deployment. More information is on the 

## Architectural Overview

![Prometheus Architecture](https://prometheus.io/assets/architecture.png)

Prometheus scrapes metrics from targets, stores data locally, and generates alerts and new time series. Visualization can be done through Grafana or APIs.

## Comparison with Other Tools
Prometheus stands out due to its:
- **Label-Based Data Model**: Enables flexible queries.
- **Local Storage**: Simplifies operations compared to distributed systems.
- **Operational Simplicity**: Minimal infrastructure required.
For comparisons, check the [comparison page](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/comparison/#comparison-to-alternatives).

## Querying with PromQL
PromQL allows real-time selection and aggregation of time series data. Examples are available on the [query examples page](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/examples/#query-examples).

## Installation
Prometheus installation options include:
- **Pre-compiled Binaries**.
- **From Source**: Build using a Makefile.
- **Docker**: Available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/prom/prometheus/).
For installation details, visit the [installation page]((https://prometheus.io/download/).

## Integration with Grafana
Prometheus integrates seamlessly with Grafana, offering rich visualization options and pre-built dashboards. Refer to the [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/prometheus/) for setup guidance.

# Grafana: Overview
Grafana is an open-source web application for analytics and visualization that connects to data sources like Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and CloudWatch. 

## Support for Prometheus
[Grafana](http://grafana.com/) effectively visualizes Prometheus metrics, allowing users to create detailed dashboards for monitoring and troubleshooting.

### Example Grafana Dashboard for Prometheus Data
Real-time visualization of Prometheus data can be easily achieved with Grafana dashboards.

## Key Features and Functionalities
### Overview
Grafana OSS lets you query, visualize, alert on, and understand your metrics, regardless of where they are stored. You can create, explore, and share dashboards to promote a data-driven culture:
- **Visualizations**: Various options, including graphs, tables, and heat maps.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: Build reusable dashboards with template variables.
- **Alerting**: Define and visualize alert rules directly in Grafana.

### Detailed Features
#### Data Exploration
Grafana offers a user-friendly interface for exploring data:
- **Explore Section**: Compare different time ranges and queries side by side.
- **Ad-Hoc Queries**: Quickly analyze metrics for troubleshooting.

#### Alerting System
Create and manage alerts that notify you through multiple channels like email and Slack:
- **Alert Rules**: Set conditions based on your metrics for immediate notifications.
- **Notification Channels**: Ensure relevant parties are alerted.

#### Annotations and Variables
- **Annotations**: Add contextual messages to graphs.
- **Variables**: Enhance dashboards with interactivity.

#### Advanced Configuration
Advanced options are accessible via the Grafana CLI or UI:
- **Data Source Configuration**: Connect to various data sources.
- **Authentication**: Supports OAuth, LDAP, and more.

#### Provisioning
Automate setup for reproducibility:
- **Provisioning**: Configure data sources and dashboards through scripts.

### Visualization Types
Grafana offers various visualizations suitable for different data presentations, such as time series, pie charts, and heatmaps.

### Dashboard Management
- **Import/Export**: Share dashboards as JSON files.
- **Playlist**: Automatically cycle through dashboards.

## Integrations and Plugins
Support for plugins adds data sources and visualizations, plus integration with external systems like PagerDuty for alerting.

## Installation and Setup
Grafana can be installed on various operating systems and via Docker. For installation instructions, visit the [Grafana installation page](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/installation/).
