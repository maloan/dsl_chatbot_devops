**Objective:**
Automate the build, test, and deployment processes to ensure continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

## Recommended Tools:
- **GitHub Actions**: Easier to set up, but slightly less powerful for Azure-hosted projects.
- **Azure Pipelines**: An alternative for integrating with Azure DevOps environments, great for complex workflows.

### Example Pipeline
- [[azure-pipelines]]
- [[github-pipelines]]

### Tradeoffs
- **Quick & Easy:** GitHub Actions offers simpler setup, but has fewer advanced features compared to Azure Pipelines.
- **Important:** Azure Pipelines provides more flexibility and integration with other Azure services, ideal if we already use Azure.
- **Nice-to-Have:** Azure Pipelines can handle multi-stage deployments and complex build environments.

### **How to Implement:**
1. Set up Azure Pipelines for running tests, building, and deploying the chatbot to Azure services like App Service or Kubernetes.
   - Alternatively, use GitHub Actions for simpler workflows.
