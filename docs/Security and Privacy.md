# [Vault by HashiCorp](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

HashiCorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. A _secret_ is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as API encryption keys, passwords, and certificates. Vault provides encryption services that are gated by authentication and authorization methods. Using Vault’s UI, CLI, or HTTP API, access to secrets and other sensitive data can be securely stored and managed, tightly controlled (restricted), and auditable.

If you are already familiar with the basics of Vault, the [documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs) provides a better reference guide for all available features as well as internals.

## What is Vault?

HashiCorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. It provides encryption services that are gated by authentication and authorization methods to ensure secure, auditable and restricted access to _secrets_. It is used to secure, store and protect secrets and other sensitive data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.

A secret is anything that you want to tightly control access to, such as tokens, API keys, passwords, encryption keys or certificates. Vault provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a detailed audit log.

API keys for external services, credentials for service-oriented architecture communication, etc. It can be difficult to understand who is accessing which secrets, especially since this can be platform-specific. Adding on key rolling, secure storage, and detailed audit logs is almost impossible without a custom solution. This is where Vault steps in.

Vault validates and authorizes clients (users, machines, apps) before providing them access to secrets or stored sensitive data.

![How Vault Works](https://developer.hashicorp.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontent.hashicorp.com%2Fapi%2Fassets%3Fproduct%3Dvault%26version%3Drefs%252Fheads%252Frelease%252F1.18.x%26asset%3Dwebsite%252Fpublic%252Fimg%252Fhow-vault-works.png%26width%3D2077%26height%3D1343&w=3840&q=75&dpl=dpl_96yUBBsTTZQ9K16zqJYnxbtydRPR)

### How does Vault work?

Vault works primarily with tokens and a token is associated to the client's policy. Each policy is path-based and policy rules constrains the actions and accessibility to the paths for each client. With Vault, you can create tokens manually and assign them to your clients, or the clients can log in and obtain a token. The illustration below displays Vault's core workflow.

The core Vault workflow consists of four stages:

- **Authenticate:** Authentication in Vault is the process by which a client supplies information that Vault uses to determine if they are who they say they are. Once the client is authenticated against an auth method, a token is generated and associated to a policy.
- **Validation:** Vault validates the client against third-party trusted sources, such as Github, LDAP, AppRole, and more.
- **Authorize**: A client is matched against the Vault security policy. This policy is a set of rules defining which API endpoints a client has access to with its Vault token. Policies provide a declarative way to grant or forbid access to certain paths and operations in Vault.
- **Access**: Vault grants access to secrets, keys, and encryption capabilities by issuing a token based on policies associated with the client’s identity. The client can then use their Vault token for future operations.

### Why Vault?

Most enterprises today have credentials sprawled across their organizations. Passwords, API keys, and credentials are stored in plain text, app source code, config files, and other locations. Because these credentials live everywhere, the sprawl can make it difficult and daunting to really know who has access and authorization to what. Having credentials in plain text also increases the potential for malicious attacks, both by internal and external attackers.

Vault was designed with these challenges in mind. Vault takes all of these credentials and centralizes them so that they are defined in one location, which reduces unwanted exposure to credentials. But Vault takes it a few steps further by making sure users, apps, and systems are authenticated and explicitly authorized to access resources, while also providing an audit trail that captures and preserves a history of clients' actions.

The key features of Vault are:

- **Secure Secret Storage**: Arbitrary key/value secrets can be stored in Vault. Vault encrypts these secrets prior to writing them to persistent storage, so gaining access to the raw storage isn't enough to access your secrets. Vault can write to disk, [Consul](https://www.consul.io/), and more.
    
- **Dynamic Secrets**: Vault can generate secrets on-demand for some systems, such as AWS or SQL databases. For example, when an application needs to access an S3 bucket, it asks Vault for credentials, and Vault will generate an AWS keypair with valid permissions on demand. After creating these dynamic secrets, Vault will also automatically revoke them after the lease is up.
    
- **Data Encryption**: Vault can encrypt and decrypt data without storing it. This allows security teams to define encryption parameters and developers to store encrypted data in a location such as a SQL database without having to design their own encryption methods.
    
- **Leasing and Renewal**: All secrets in Vault have a _lease_ associated with them. At the end of the lease, Vault will automatically revoke that secret. Clients are able to renew leases via built-in renew APIs.
    
- **Revocation**: Vault has built-in support for secret revocation. Vault can revoke not only single secrets, but a tree of secrets, for example all secrets read by a specific user, or all secrets of a particular type. Revocation assists in key rolling as well as locking down systems in the case of an intrusion.

## [](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/use-cases#general-secret-storage)

## General secret storage

As workloads become more and more ephemeral and short-lived, having long-lived static credentials pose a big security threat vector. What if credentials are accidentally leaked, or an employee leaves with their post it notes that contain the AWS access key, or someone checks their S3 access token into a public GH repo? With Vault, you can generate short-lived, just-in-time credentials that are automatically revoked when their time expires. This means users and security teams do not have to worry about manually revoking or changing these credentials.

### [](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/use-cases#static-secrets)

### Static secrets

Credentials can be long-lived and static, where they don't change or are changed infrequently. Vault can store these secrets behind its cryptographic barrier, and clients can request them to use in their applications.

## Data encryption

Many organizations seek solutions to encrypt/decrypt application data within a cloud or multi-datacenter environment; deploying cryptography and maintaining a complex key management infrastructure can be expensive and challenging to develop. Vault provides [encryption as a service](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/transit) with centralized key management to simplify encrypting data in transit and stored across clouds and datacenters. Vault can encrypt/decrypt data stored elsewhere, essentially allowing applications to encrypt their data while storing it in the primary data store. Vault's security team manages and maintains the responsibility of the data encryption within the Vault environment, allowing developers to focus solely on encrypting/decrypting data as needed.

## [](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/use-cases#identity-based-access)

## Identity-Based access

Organizations need a way to manage identity sprawl with the proliferation of different clouds, services, and systems- all with their identity providers. The risk of compromising an organization's security infrastructure increases as organizations are forced to manage multiple identity management systems as they try to implement solutions to unify a single logical identity across numerous cloud platforms. Different platforms support different methods and constructs for identity, making it difficult to recognize a user or identity across multiple forms of credentials. Vault solves this challenge by using a unified ACL system to broker access to systems and secrets and merges identities across providers. With [identity-based access](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/identity), organizations can leverage any trusted resource identity to regulate and manage system and application access, and authentication across various clouds, systems, and endpoints.

## [](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/use-cases#key-management)

## Key management

Working with cloud providers requires that you use their security features, which involve encryption keys issued and stored by the provider in its own key management system (KMS). You may also have a requirement to maintain root of trust and control of the encryption key lifecycle, both within and outside of the cloud. The [Vault Key Management Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/secrets/key-management) provides a consistent workflow for distribution and lifecycle management of cloud provider keys, allowing organizations to maintain centralized control of their keys in Vault while leveraging the cryptographic capabilities native to the KMS providers.
