Prices are estimates only and are not intended as actual price quotes. Actual pricing may vary depending on the type of agreement entered with Microsoft, date of purchase, and the currency exchange rate. Prices are calculated based on US dollars and converted using London closing spot rates that are captured in the two business days prior to the last business day of the previous month end. If the two business days prior to the end of the month fall on a bank holiday in major markets, the rate setting day is generally the day immediately preceding the two business days. This rate applies to all transactions during the upcoming month. Sign in to the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/) to see pricing based on your current program/offer with Microsoft. Contact an [Azure sales specialist](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/pricing/) for more information on pricing or to request a price quote.
