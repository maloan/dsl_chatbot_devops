## What is CSML?

CSML (Conversational Standard Meta Language) is an open-source programming language specifically designed for building chatbot applications. It simplifies the creation and management of interactive dialogue systems using a text-only syntax. Developed in Rust, CSML offers an easy-to-understand language that enables developers to build advanced chatbots without the complexity of traditional programming languages.
