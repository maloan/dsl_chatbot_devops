# Automated Testing for Chatbot

**Objective:**
Automate tests to validate that the chatbot functions correctly after each change.

## Recommended Tools:
- **Unit Testing:**
  - **Pytest**: For unit testing the chatbotâ€™s core functions.
  - **unittest**: Built-in Python testing framework.
  
- **End-to-End Testing:**
  - **Botium**: Tailored for chatbot testing.
  - **Selenium/Cypress**: For web-based chatbots, testing the user interface.

- **Performance Testing:**
  - **Locust**: Simulates traffic to test scalability and performance.
 
### Example Code
- [[test_chatbot]]

### Tradeoffs
- **Quick & Easy:** `pytest` or `unittest`, quick to implement and ideal for unit tests, but limited to backend logic testing.
- **Important:** `Botium` enables full conversation testing, but requires more setup, especially for NLP-based bots.
- **Nice-to-Have:** Implement performance tests with `Locust` to stress-test the chatbot for future scalability.

### Steps for Implementing
1. Write unit tests, integration tests using `pytest` (`test_chatbot.py`).
2. Set up Botium for end-to-end (E2E) testing of chatbot conversations.
3. Automate these tests with Azure Pipelines or Github action to run on each commit/pull request.
